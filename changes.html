<h2>Fixed Addon Crash</h2>
<p>A crash could occur when two addons contained the same filename - and one of them threw a Lua error. This is now fixed.</p>

<h2>Fixed invisible player models</h2>
<p>A merge error in the last update caused a bug where you couldn't see your own player model in reflections, or taunts etc. This should now be fixed!</p>

<h2>Disable autorefresh</h2>
<p>If you're that way inclined you can now disable lua autorefresh. This won't affect the huge majority of GMod players out there - but some server admins have requested it asthey feel it slows their servers down (because they're writing a lot of files all the time). To disable add -disableluarefresh to your command line.</p>

<h2>Added bodygroup properties</h2>
<p>Open the properties menu on an entity with bodygroups and you'll be able to edit them! Finally!</p>

<h2>Added skin  properties</h2>
<p>The same as bodygroup properties - but for skins!</p>

<h2>Fixed Scenes not finding !player</h2>
<p>Sometimes scene sequences in maps couldn't find an entity called !player. Even though the player was there. This would be mostly happening in multiplayer - and should now be fixed!</p>

<h2>Fixed downloads folder</h2>
<p>When you join a server and it downloads a bunch of crap, it's all meant to go into the downloads folder, so your install doesn't get infected with all the online insanity. This wasn't happening all the time though. This is now fixed - all the downloads should go to the downloads folder :)</p>

<h2>Disable LuaJIT</h2>
<p>Some people feel that the JIT part in LuaJIT slows their servers down. You can now start with LuaJIT disabled by running with -nojit.</p>

<h2>Added entity callback BuildBonePositions</h2>
<p>You can now call <a href='http://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Classes/Entity/AddCallback'>AddCallback</a>( "BuildBonePositions", myfunc ) to add a callback that should work the same as the historic BuildBonePositions hook. A lot of coders have requested this as this hook gives a greater degree of freedom (at the cost of a performance overhead) over the <a href='http://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Classes/Entity/ManipulateBonePosition'>ManipulateBone</a> functions.
.</p>

<h2>PlayerSwitchWeapon hook return</h2>
<p>Returning true in PlayerSwitchWeapon now prevents the switch. This was requested by the community. There is a chance that this could break some weapons that are already out there - but only if they're returning true for some reason.</p>

<h2>Cleaner Kicking</h2>
<p>When being kicked from a server it would previously show a message like "Kicked by Console: Blah Blah Blah". We dropped the kicked by console part - now it will just show "Blah Blah Blah". </p>

<h2>Added Player:ScreenFade</h2>
<p>As requested by the community, <a href='http://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Classes/Player/ScreenFade'>this function</a> is a 1:1 binding of the UTIL_ScreenFade engine function.</p>

<h2>Added Weapon:DrawHUDBackground</h2>
<p>A HUD drawing hook for SWEPs that is called before drawing the chat and killicons.</p>

<h2>Dedicated Servers use Workshop Collections</h2>
<p>Throw away your workshop.vdf file - because you don't need it. The workshop for dedicated server system now works the same way as <a href='https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/CSGO_Workshop_For_Server_Operators'>CS:GO</a>. </p>

<h2>Added CheckPassword hook</h2>
<p>A long requested hook that allows Lua to control the join process. This should duplicate the functionality of the gatekeeper module that a lot of servers use - and might even break gatekeeper itself - because the engine no longer calls the functions that it hooks.</p>

<h2>Fixed trails crash exploit</h2>
<p>It was possible to crash all clients on a server by specifying an invalid material for the trails tool. This has been fixed by locking down the list of usable materials to a list set by the server.</p>

<h2>Mount any gma files</h2>
<p>GMA files are Garry's Mod Addon files. You can now copy a GMA into the garrysmod folder (or garrysmod/addons/gma/) and have them mount just like they'd been downloaded from Workshop. This should be useful for people who don't want to use workshop for some reason, and people who want to test their addons offline before uploading them to workshop.</p>

<h2>Legacy Addon Mounting Changes</h2>
<p>The Legacy Addon System previously required an addon.txt file in the addon folder. This is no longer the case. This requirement has been removed for ease of use. This means that any GMod 12 addons you have in addons/ will start mounting again. These might cause some problems - so be sure to clean them out before complaining.</p>

<h2>Workshop Censorship</h2>
<p>If you upload a save, demo or dupe that contains a banned word - it will be marked as private so only your friends can see it. I'm hoping this will reduce the number of naked/sex contributions we're seeing!</p>

<h2>Flechette Gun is back</h2>
<p>Something happened somewhere that stopped the flechette from spawning. Robotboy spotted it! He made a pull request that gave it us back!</p>

<h2>Added Spawnpoints for most mountable games</h2>
<p>Robotboy submitted a pull request that will let you spawn in a bunch of maps that you couldn't spawn in before.</p>

<h2>TTT changes</h2>
<p>fix scrollbar showing in search when not needed, fix NPCs leaving DNA traces on corpses </p>

<h2>Added admin only icon</h2>
<p>Robotboy sorted you out with this fix. Now you can see which entities in the spawnmenu are admin only - so you don't have to bother trying to spawn them!</p>

<h2>Fixed static camera being able to knocked over </h2>
<p>Yet another update from Git Pull Superstar Robotboy. This makes it so you can't knock or shoot the camera over. I'm sure a lot of people will appreciate this! And everyone else will moan that they loved being able to shoot and knock it over. Oh well.</p>
