<h2>Unified viewmodel system</h2>
<p>The arms and hands you see in first person will now change according to your chosen player model! This is usable by SWeps too - they just need to update.</p>

<h2>Some more tool models</h2>
<p>There are more new models available for some tools.</p>

<h2>Fixed NPCs going into T-pose</h2>
<p>Half-Life 2: Deathmatch was overriding the animations from other games - this has been fixed.</p>

<h2>Counter-Strike: Source weapons</h2>
<p>You do not need to have CS:S mounted anymore to see them! The models now ship as part of Garry's Mod, because they were improved to integrate far better with our player animations. If you do not have CS:S mounted, however, very low resolution textures will be used instead (a system that has been in place for a few updates now).</p>

<h2>Player model updates</h2>
<p>Some newer systems used by Valve were retrofitted onto Garry's Mod's animations, so they now blend together much more naturally. Some more animations have been added, such as crouch-walking as a zombie. The knife and dual-wielding animations were updated - but that's barely scratching the surface, as many other improvements were made too.</p>
