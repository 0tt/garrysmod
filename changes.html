<h2>Fixed invisible player models</h2>
<p>A merge error in the last update caused a bug where you couldn't see your own player model in reflections, or taunts etc. This should now be fixed!</p>

<h2>Disable autorefresh</h2>
<p>If you're that way inclined you can now disable lua autorefresh. This won't affect the huge majority of GMod players out there - but some server admins have requested it asthey feel it slows their servers down (because they're writing a lot of files all the time). To disable add -disableluarefresh to your command line.</p>
