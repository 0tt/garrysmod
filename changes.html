<h2>Some more tool models</h2>
<p>There's a couple of new balloon models available by default now! Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Fixed NPCs going into T-pose</h2>
<p>blah blah blah</p>

<h2>Player model updates</h2>
<p>Some newer systems used by Valve were retrofitted onto Garry's Mod's animations, so they now blend together much more naturally. Some more animations have been added, such as crouch-walking as a zombie.</p>
