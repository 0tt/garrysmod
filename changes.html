<h2>Fixed invisible player models</h2>
<p>A merge error in the last update caused a bug where you couldn't see your own player model in reflections, or taunts etc. This should now be fixed!</p>

<h2>Disable autorefresh</h2>
<p>If you're that way inclined you can now disable lua autorefresh. This won't affect the huge majority of GMod players out there - but some server admins have requested it asthey feel it slows their servers down (because they're writing a lot of files all the time). To disable add -disableluarefresh to your command line.</p>

<h2>Fixed Scenes not finding !player</h2>
<p>Sometimes scene sequences in maps couldn't find an entity called !player. Even though the player was there. This would be mostly happening in multiplayer - and should now be fixed!</p>

<h2>Disable LuaJIT</h2>
<p>Some people feel that the JIT part in LuaJIT slows their servers down. You can now start with LuaJIT disabled by running with -nojit.</p>


<h2>Added entity callback BuildBonePositions</h2>
<p>You can now call <a href='http://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Classes/Entity/AddCallback'>AddCallback</a>( "BuildBonePositions", myfunc ) to add a callback that should work the same as the historic BuildBonePositions hook. A lot of coders have requested this as this hook gives a greater degree of freedom (at the cost of a performance overhead) over the <a href='http://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Classes/Entity/ManipulateBonePosition'>ManipulateBone</a> functions.
