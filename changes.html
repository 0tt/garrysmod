<h2>Fixed Addon Crash</h2>
<p>A crash could occur when two addons contained the same filename - and one of them threw a Lua error. This is now fixed.</p>

<h2>Fixed invisible player models</h2>
<p>A merge error in the last update caused a bug where you couldn't see your own player model in reflections, or taunts etc. This should now be fixed!</p>

<h2>Disable autorefresh</h2>
<p>If you're that way inclined you can now disable lua autorefresh. This won't affect the huge majority of GMod players out there - but some server admins have requested it asthey feel it slows their servers down (because they're writing a lot of files all the time). To disable add -disableluarefresh to your command line.</p>

<h2>Fixed Scenes not finding !player</h2>
<p>Sometimes scene sequences in maps couldn't find an entity called !player. Even though the player was there. This would be mostly happening in multiplayer - and should now be fixed!</p>

<h2>Fixed downloads folder</h2>
<p>When you join a server and it downloads a bunch of crap, it's all meant to go into the downloads folder, so your install doesn't get infected with all the online insanity. This wasn't happening all the time though. This is now fixed - all the downloads should go to the downloads folder :)</p>

<h2>Disable LuaJIT</h2>
<p>Some people feel that the JIT part in LuaJIT slows their servers down. You can now start with LuaJIT disabled by running with -nojit.</p>

<h2>Added entity callback BuildBonePositions</h2>
<p>You can now call <a href='http://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Classes/Entity/AddCallback'>AddCallback</a>( "BuildBonePositions", myfunc ) to add a callback that should work the same as the historic BuildBonePositions hook. A lot of coders have requested this as this hook gives a greater degree of freedom (at the cost of a performance overhead) over the <a href='http://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Classes/Entity/ManipulateBonePosition'>ManipulateBone</a> functions.
.</p>

<h2>PlayerSwitchWeapon hook return</h2>
<p>Returning true in PlayerSwitchWeapon now prevents the switch. This was requested by the community. There is a chance that this could break some weapons that are already out there - but only if they're returning true for some reason.</p>

<h2>Cleaner Kicking</h2>
<p>When being kicked from a server it would previously show a message like "Kicked by Console: Blah Blah Blah". We dropped the kicked by console part - now it will just show "Blah Blah Blah". </p>
